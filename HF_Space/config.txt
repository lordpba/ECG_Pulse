# Configuration file for HF Spaces deployment

# Hardware recommendations
# - CPU basic: May not work due to model size
# - T4 small: Recommended minimum for PULSE-7B
# - A10G small: Better performance
# - A100: Best performance

# Environment variables (if needed)
# TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/tmp/transformers_cache
# HF_HOME=/tmp/hf_home

# Notes for deployment:
# 1. Make sure to select T4 small or better GPU
# 2. The model will download on first run (~14GB)
# 3. First inference may take longer due to model loading
# 4. Consider adding authentication if needed for private use
